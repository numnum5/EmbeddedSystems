Readme for motorLib package

 motorlib.h - Defines and Macros for driving motor for EGH456 motor kits.

 Setup:
       1. Please make sure that the pins for the 
          INHA, INLA, INHB, INLB, INHC, INLC, MODE or 
          ENABLE are not reconfigured. See reference 
          documentation for which GPIO ports and pins 
          these are defined as. The updateMotor() function
          utilises these GPIO lines to drive the motor phases
       
       2. Please ensure you don't use Timer0 which is 
         currently used by the motorLib for PWM purposes
          
      3. Make sure you inlude add the build flags -l libmotorLib & -L lib/motorlib 
         in your platformio.ini settings and that the libmotorlib.a 
         file exists in your lib folder within your platformio project
	   

Usage:

      This library has been created simply to drive the lines of the motor safely.
      Firstly you will need to initialise the motor library by calling initMotor().
      
      e.g.   initMotorLib(50);      
     
      		 will initialise the pwm module and set the period of the PWM cycle to
      		 50 microseconds. This determines the frqeuency of the PWM (1/50e-6) = 20Khz
      		 It is recommended to have a PWM frequency > 10KhZ. Feel free to change this 
      		 period but this number determines the Max duty cycle that you can apply which
      		 determines the resolution of your pwm duty 
      		 
      		 	i.e. 50 pwm period = 0 to 50 steps for the duty value
      		 		 10 pwm period = 0 to 10 steps for the duty value
      
      Simply use the updateMotor() function to set the appropriate lines based on
      phase indicated by the hall effect sensors (to be determined by you). The
      Library uses the 6x PWM mode of the motor drive to drive the motor

      e.g.   updateMotor(1, 0, 1) where 1, 0, 1 should be replaced with the readings from the GPIO lines

             Will set the motor lines for the motor phase corresponding to
             Hall effect sensor states - H3=0,H2=1,H1=1.

      You should integrate the updateMotor function into your application. You will also need
      to read the Hall effect sensors via the GPIO lines. It is recommended that you use a 
      GPIO interrupt to sense when a hall effect line has changed.
      
      In order to get the motor to spin to a certain speed you will need to set 
      the Duty cycle of the PWM using the setDuty() function. 
      
      e.g.   setDuty(25)
      
      	     will set the PWM duty to 25 microseconds (50% Duty Cycle if PWM Period = 50). 
      	     The maximum value is determined by the period of the PWM set from the initialisation 
      	     function. This function checks the maximum duty based on the PWM period and caps the input:
      	      
      	      i.e. if(duty > MAX_DUTY) duty = PWM_MAX_DUTY;
